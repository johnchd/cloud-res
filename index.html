<h2>Why this website was made: </h2>
	<p>
		<ul>
			After plateuing finding bugs, I decided it was time to learn something new. 
			I came across the Cloud Resume Challenge and decided to give it a shot.
			<br>
			The goal behind this challenge for me was to learn backend/frontend technologies to help me find more bugs.

			<br>
			<br>
			I also wanted to have a place to write about stuff I'm currently learning.

<h3> Process of creating this website: </h3>
	<ol>
		<!-- Step 1 -->
		<li>Created a basic HTML page and uploaded this to an S3 bucket </li>

		<!-- Step 2 -->
		<li>Created a CloudFront distribution to host the files within my S3 bucket </li>

		<!-- Step 3 -->
		<li>Bought domain on GoDaddy </li>
			<ul>
	 			<li> Used Route53 to create a hosted zone for the domain purchased on GoDaddy. From here went on to retrieve the address of nameservers. </li>
	 			<li>Added the above nameservers into GoDaddy. When users go to johncrynick.com, they get forwarded to my AWS infrastructure (CloudFront) </li> 
	 			<li> After nameservers were updated in Route53, went on to use Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM) to setup https </li> 
			</ul>

		<!-- Step 4 -->
		<li>Created 2 DynamoDB tables for: </li>
			<ul>
				<li> how many people visited the site </li>
				<li> who visited the site </li>
			</ul>

		<!-- Step 5 -->
		<li>Created Lambada functions written in Python that log information to the DB tables. </li>

		<!-- Step 6 -->
		<li>Created 2 API's for: </li>
			<ul>
				<li> counting visitors </li>
				<li> logging visitors who visted the website </li>
			</ul>

		Rather than communication from my website to the DB, I made the 2 interact via an API. <br> Basically everytime a user would visit my website, the API is invoked - triggering the Lambada function and add adding the information to the respective DB table. 

		<!-- Step 7 -->
		<li> Updated HTML to invoke these API's using JS </li>

		<!-- Step 8 -->
		<li> Implmeneted CI/CD pipeline using Github to update my S3 bucket. </li>

            };
            // make API call with parameters and use promises to get response
            fetch("https://wm8qa9fr69.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/nameLogger", requestOptions)
            .then(response => response.text())
            .then(result => alert(JSON.parse(result).body))
            .catch(error => console.log('error', error));
